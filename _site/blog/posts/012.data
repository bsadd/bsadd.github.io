<p>Still I can recall the day when I learned my first lesson on Android development which was taught by Ahsanul Karim bhaiya. As a student of Level-2 Term-1, we all had to write code in Java and C++ for academic purposes. At that time a workshop was arranged on Android platform by our department. From there I got all the necessary materials to develop projects in Android platform. It was started with toasting a message in android simulator and ended up in developing a small scale android app by the end of the month. Slowly I learned to develop Android app and then was able to make some “cool” projects (I think silly may fit the best here :p). </p>

<p><blockquote>My development career got boosted up by BSADD</blockquote> Let me give a brief about BSADD. BUET Systems Analysis, Design &amp; Development Group known as BSADD is a group whose main target is to help other to have knowledge in different fields of software development. It introduces technologies that will help when one enters into the software-industry world. It has already organized some contests, hack-a-thon for the current students in different platform for increasing their efficiency and improve their skills. I can give one example which may reflect the impact of the lessons that are being taught in BSADD. I first heard and learned about GIT (a version control tool to collaborate with other members when working in a team) in a session that was arranged by BSADD. In software-industry, when you work in a big team, it is a must practice to use a version control tool. When I was in the final year, I along with my other friends took some sessions and tried to teach to write code in different platform. During under graduation, I developed some apps and published those in the play store. At that time, I also worked as a part time software developer in a local company. </p>

 <p>Right now, I am working as an engineer in KSL(Kona Software Lab Limited). Before giving a description of my role here, I would like to give a short introduction about KSL. It is basically an R&D center and global solution business wing of South Korean smart card industry pioneer, Kona I Co., Ltd. Konai manufactures smart cards, develop various state-of- the-art payments and security solutions; and deliver to clients across the global markets. It is my first job as a full time software developer. I spent almost one year in KSL. In this short interval, I got several chances to work in different projects. From the scratch to the release phase, each and every process is well organized and all the steps are done in a structured way like other big companies of Bangladesh and overseas companies. Before working here, I have no knowledge about how do the big companies maintain all their projects and other stuffs, how do the members of a big team collaborate with each other and also how the collaboration between different teams are done. Here I am surprised to see big projects being divided into some small components which fasten the rapid development process. We are not robot who just sit in front of a computer and write bunches of lines of codes all day long. We go for hangout, enjoy gossiping with each-other besides doing work, enjoy going to recreational places etc. All the people working here from the project manager to the team leader, are very helpful, skilled and supportive. All those things are pretty much common in these days in big companies. I also heard about the same process and techniques that are practiced in other software companies in Bangladesh.</p>
