<p>In my last three years of work experience I have face some difficulties, made some mistakes. I am sharing my point of view in the section below.  </p>
 
<p>When I was done with our final exam in 4-2, I had started thinking about my career.Most of us try to get a job. Some are trying to go for higher education, but the large portion of students try to get a job. To support our self it is very necessary to get a job after final exam.So everyone starts applying for jobs in various software companies.</p>
 
<p>Within a few months 80-90 percent students starts their career in  software companies. Software engineering is very interesting and challenging job. I starts to learn the beauty of developing a product. Some time I give 60 to 70 hrs in a week to our office. Some time I have to sacrifice weekends to meet strict deadline. Some this job tests our ability to the limit.</p>
 
<p>In the first couple of years of my career I have learn some thing. The most important thing from the job we are receiving  it is not money. Knowledge is the most important thing. If any one thinks that he is not learning something from his/her job , no matter how much money they receive from the company, they should start to find another one. Because first two to three years of one’s career is the most important time in the life ahead.</p>
 
<p>I saw some people switching jobs for some amount of money. But office environment and learning opportunities are more important than the salary we got. If there is no option for learning it will hamper one’s career in upcoming few years.</p>
 
<p>After graduation I had joined a startup. There was no supervision for me. I have to learn by myself. So within few months I thought I have to switch job. Then I got a chance in a multi-national company. At the time there was quite a nice environment and A lot of scope to learn new things. But the work pressure was too high. Once I had to work for 12 to 14 hrs in a day two weeks in a row. That time I learn how much pressure I can handle.</p>
 
<p>After one year I find myself exact same kind of situation. But this time not in Dhaka, In our company’s  headquarter. That time was more difficult. To work with different kind of people. There was language barrier, office culture was different. It was hard to eat korean food. But this time I am able handle the workload with my previous experience. </p>
 
<br/><p>When I was trying to get a job after graduation, I forgot the most important thing that, I should thinking after completing undergrad. That is, “where I want to see myself in next 10 years”. That was my biggest mistake in last three years. Everyone should make a plan according to their goal. It is very difficult to build a career in Bangladesh. One of the reason is the software industry in our country is very unstable. One year they are in a very good situation in the next they shut down. So if anyone planning to go abroad, whether it is for higher education or job in google, facebook etc, they should start working on those beside office work.</p>
 
<p>There are a lot of path in front of us. We can chose any one of them, and start to work hard to succeed in that path. We always have to look behind. To judge our present self with our past. Are we making any progress , if yes, then we have to work hard to keep it up, and if not then we have to work harder to cover the losses. All the things we do , job study etc, to build our self, to learn. The only thing we can take from one job is our knowledge. So we have to keep learning, and try to become the person where I want to see myself in next 10 years.</p>
