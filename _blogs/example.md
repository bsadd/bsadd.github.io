Almost 6 years since I have graduated with my BS in Computer Science from BUET. I have spent half of this time in industry (Research and Development, Software Engineer) and the other half in academia (MS and PhD student, RA/TA/Fellow). I have seen and learned a lot from both of this world. I have been lucky to be in places I never thought I would be. At the same time I have been through struggle and changes which were really hard and tiring; places where dreams and nightmares are indistinguishable. This note is a reflection things I wish my younger self have known.

1.  There no right answers to the debate of academia vs. industry. It's up to you. As long as you are ready to work hard, learn new things, and ready to make the right switches, you are going to be good.
2.  The amount of things one can learn is limitless. Every time I have left a job, I wish I could learn a bit more. I know many graduate students who don't enjoy being a teaching assistant. But, for me, sharing your knowledge, guiding new minds, learning how to communicate with new people; it's a fascinating experience. I wish I could learn more from there!
3.  About graduate study, it's not about getting a better job, it's not about getting some foreign visa; it's about the experience, it's the people you meet, the things you see and learn. Priceless.
4.  About software development job, solving interesting problems is one of the most fascinating things you would ever do. Make sure that you are solving the problem you love.
5.  For those who think it is too late for graduate school, it's never late to learn. Just listen to your guts. Keep dreaming.
6.  Current graduate students, I feel you. Hang in there! Darker the night is, party harder ;)

Last but not the least; honor, responsibility, empathy; knowing the meaning of these words and being truly one is so different. These are the very fabric of human civilization and these traits are valued everywhere. Continue working hard, keep dreaming. Your possibilities are as big as your dreams!
