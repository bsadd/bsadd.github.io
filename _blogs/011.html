<p>Assalamu Alaikum,</p>

<p>I will be writing here few words on my experience after graduating from BUET on 2009. First thing that always comes to my mind is keep your GPA expectation high, which means study harder and get it. Don’t do an MS from BUET. One year before the expected graduation time, start preparing for GRE (you must get at least almost full marks in Math), and appear on the GRE exam right after your final semester. Apply to the North American universities and this is when your GPA will play a key role in admission alongside the GRE. Before you come to America, have some fun and enjoy for couple month because the struggle is ahead. Get married before coming here if possible, this will make you a hard worker and you will fulfill the half of the religion. When you come here struggle more, look for deals before buying anything, and learn how to survive in America as a graduate student. Save money whenever possible. Try to finish MS asap, people do it in as short as 1 year only. Look for job (this is not what I did, but I think that’s more suitable), if you don’t get job then finish PhD. Every year during PhD do summer internship. During the last year of the PhD, start preparing for Coding Interview (that itself is a different topic). As a BUET CSE graduate (honestly BUET is the best), inshAllah you should get a position in any of the big technology companies. Then Enjoy J.</p>

<p>Wait a minute, you missed the most important part. Make dua, make dua, make dua, because you will not survive without the help of Allah.</p>
