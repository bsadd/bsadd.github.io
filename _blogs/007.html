<p>I am not good at writing. So just trying give few tips that I thought would have been helpful for me at the time of joining my office. And they are almost basics.</p>

<ol>
<li>Have some knowledge about version controlling system. At least the core concepts. Like pull, push, fetch, merge commands.</li>
<li>Get enough confidence of using atleast one IDE totally.</li>
<li>Before joining the company, gather some basic knowledge about their work and roam around those techs in internet. There will not be a lot of tech out there (applicable for our local companies only). trust me. </li>
<li>Have some knowledge about debugging. How techs are debugged. Its really useful while going through a new tech.</li>
<li>Build the ability to come up with solutions effectively. forget that people are going to help you in every difficulties.</li>
<li>Try shaping your mind to be able to setup development environment. If you are failing to do a setup, try googling. You are not always the first person to face an error for the first time. :P</li>
<li>Forget that you know everything. Just be confident on topics that you are confident with. I saw many who do's a lot of pokpok's (extra talking I mean :P) but in practical fails to do almost simple things.</li>
<li>The less you are dependent on others, the more professional you are becoming.</li>
</ol>
