 In these sessions, the discussion was mostly based on what is going on with the ever-evolving tech industry
 at the moment. There were 3 sessions on "Hands on Security" where our guests discussed
 about the various aspects of system security. A session on "GO" (aka GOLang) also made its way to our TechLives for those
 who are always on-the-go. Find the recorded sessions here in Q/A format.
