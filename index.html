                    <hr/>
                    <p>BUET has an outstanding image on Programming Contest in local and global platforms for years. For competitive programming contest, we have teams who get extensive training and motivation from some of our amazing ex-contestants and they participate in various local and global contests regularly. But the picture was somewhat different for software analysis/development. A couple of years back we had no organized way of getting trained in software development. We got some success stories in different development contests, but those were mostly result of personal efforts. There was very limited scope of sharing the knowledge we had for not having a organized effort or a community. To diminish this lacking of an organized effort and proper direction, BSADD was born.</p>
                    <p>The main goal of BSADD is creating a platform, where we can learn and share the knowledge about the best practices in software development. It serves as a community where the software enthusiasts participate and share their expertise to bridge the gap between our students and the industry. BSADD arranges training sessions, contests, design challenges in online and offline platform focusing on software design, research in regular basis. It also guides the students who participate in local and international contests. Our motto is growing the culture of software design and development among the students.</p>
                    <p>From its inception BSADD has been arranging various training sessions, contests, design challenges from time to time. On  a regular basis we invite professionals from the industry, so that we can always be up to date with the state-of-art methods. By creating a helpful learning environment, BSADD paves the way for a skilled software development community.</p>

                        <p>Hi everyone, I hope all of you are doing pretty well. When I was asked to say something about BSADD, the first thing that sprang in my mind is that, BSADD is the first of it's kind in Bangladesh in terms of student community that focuses on promoting Software Design and Development practices among students. </p>

                        <p>The great thing about BSADD is that it's a well drilled organization run solely by the students. From managing weekly tutorial sessions to encouraging the use of cutting edge tools and organizing Software Design and Development Contests at national levels. You name it, BSADD has always been at the forefront of everything and students have always been at the heart of it. And that too from a sense of a dedication to our Department, giving something back.</p>

                        <p>I have been fortunate enough to see all these great things I have told about BSADD from the very beginning. The aim of BSADD has always been to bridge the gap between industry and academia and give the students a sense of the practical scenario. It will be really unfair, if I do not acknowledge the contribution of the CSE'07 batch who established BSADD and made it all possible. From then 2008 batch took over the battle and took BSADD forward. I hope that 2009 batch is also doing a great job.</p>

                        <p>So that's all I had to say about BSADD. I wish you all the best and I hope that BSADD will always remain as a success story and continue to thrive.</p>
